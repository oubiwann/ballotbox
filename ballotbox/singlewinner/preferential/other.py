    """
    Bucklin voting is a class of voting systems that can be used for
    single-member and multi-member districts. It is named after its original
    promoter, James W. Bucklin of Grand Junction, Colorado, and is also known
    as the Grand Junction system. As in Majority Judgment, the Bucklin winner
    will be one of the candidates with the highest median ranking or rating.

    Voters are allowed rank preference ballots (first, second, third, etc.).

    First choice votes are first counted. If one candidate has a majority, that
    candidate wins. Otherwise the second choices are added to the first
    choices. Again, if a candidate with a majority vote is found, the winner is
    the candidate with the most votes accumulated. Lower rankings are added as
    needed.

    A majority is determined based on the number of valid ballots. Since, after
    the first round, there may be more votes cast than voters, it is possible
    for more than one candidate to have majority support.
