Copeland's Method
-----------------

Below is an example of an election that took place between 5 candidates
competing for one seat::

    >>> from ballotbox.ballot import BallotBox
    >>> from ballotbox.singlewinner.plurality import FirstPastPostVoting
    >>> from ballotbox.singlewinner.preferential import CopelandVoting

    >>> rounds = []
    >>> round1 = BallotBox(method=FirstPastPostVoting)
    >>> round1.add_votes({"alice": 41, "bob": 59})
    >>> rounds.append(round1)

    >>> round2 = BallotBox(method=FirstPastPostVoting)
    >>> round2.add_votes({"alice": 71, "carol": 29})
    >>> rounds.append(round2)

    >>> round3 = BallotBox(method=FirstPastPostVoting)
    >>> round3.add_votes({"alice": 61, "dave": 39})
    >>> rounds.append(round3)

    >>> round4 = BallotBox(method=FirstPastPostVoting)
    >>> round4.add_votes({"alice": 71, "eve": 0})
    >>> rounds.append(round4)

    >>> round5 = BallotBox(method=FirstPastPostVoting)
    >>> round5.add_votes({"bob": 30, "carol": 60})
    >>> rounds.append(round5)

    >>> round6 = BallotBox(method=FirstPastPostVoting)
    >>> round6.add_votes({"bob": 30, "dave": 70})
    >>> rounds.append(round6)

    >>> round7 = BallotBox(method=FirstPastPostVoting)
    >>> round7.add_votes({"bob": 59, "eve": 41})
    >>> rounds.append(round7)

    >>> round8 = BallotBox(method=FirstPastPostVoting)
    >>> round8.add_votes({"carol": 60, "dave": 10})
    >>> rounds.append(round8)

    >>> round9 = BallotBox(method=FirstPastPostVoting)
    >>> round9.add_votes({"carol": 71, "eve": 29})
    >>> rounds.append(round9)

    >>> round10 = BallotBox(method=FirstPastPostVoting)
    >>> round10.add_votes({"dave": 39, "eve": 61})
    >>> rounds.append(round10)

    >>> bb = BallotBox(method=CopelandVoting)
    >>> bb.get_winner(rounds)
    [(2, 'alice')]


The Kemeny-Young Method
-----------------------

Here is a fictional vote to move the capital of Tennessee. The inhabitants of
each city want to have the capital as close to their city as possible, if their
city doesn't actually win. Each voter will list their preferences for the state
capital from most desired to least.

The candidates for the capital are:

 * Memphis, the state's largest city, with 42% of the voters, but located far
   from the other cities

 * Nashville, with 26% of the voters, near the center of Tennessee

 * Knoxville, with 17% of the voters

 * Chattanooga, with 15% of the voters

Here the code that determines the winner::

    >>> from ballotbox.singlewinner.preferential import KemenyYoungVoting

    >>> bb = BallotBox(method=CopelandVoting)
    >>> bb.get_winner(rounds)
    [(2, 'alice')]
