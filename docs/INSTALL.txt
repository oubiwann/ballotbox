Installation
============

Development
-----------

If you want to develop for ballotbox or use the latest code we're working on,
you can install from the sources. You'll need bzr installed, and then just do
the following::

    $ bzr branch lp:ballotbox
    $ cd ballotbox
    $ sudo python setup.py install


Easy Install
------------

You can use the setuptools easy_install script to get ballotbox on your
system::

    $ sudo easy_install ballotbox


Manual Download
---------------

You can manually download the source tarball from the Python Package Index by
visiting the following URL:

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ballotbox

You'll need to untar and gunzip the source, cd into the source directory, and
then you can do the usual::

    $ sudo python setup.py install


Checking the Source
-------------------

Once installed, as long as you have Twisted installed on your system and the
trial script in your PATH, you can test the source code by executing this
anywhere::

    $ trial ballotbox

That will run the test suite and report on the success and failure of any unit
tests.
