[DONE] Convert the criteria classes to use interfaces. Then, instead of
subclassing these in the voting methods, they would implement them. This will
make zope.interface a dependency.

[DONE] Copy multi-doctest file test suite code from txULS/soom to here.

[DONE] Add a new docs/methods directory and a file for each voting method.

Add doctests for each voting method.

Add a make target that tests the source dist:

 * create a temp dir

 * untar the dist there

 * run the unit tests and doctests against that directory
